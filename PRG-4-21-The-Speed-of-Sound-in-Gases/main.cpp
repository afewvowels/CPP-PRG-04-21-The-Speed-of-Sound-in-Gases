//  When sound travels through a gas, its speed depends primarily on the density of
//  the medium. The less dense the medium, the faster the speed will be. The following
//  table shows the approximate speed of sound at 0 degrees centrigrade, measured
//  in meters per second, when traveling through carbon dioxide, air, helium,
//  and hydrogen.
//
//  Medium                              Speed (Meters per Second)
//  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Carbon dioxide                      258.0
//  Air                                 331.5
//  Helium                              972.0
//  Hydrogen                            1,270.0
//
//  Write a program that displays a menu allowing the user to select one of these four
//  gases. After a selection has been made, the user should enter the number of seconds, it
//  took for the sound to travel in this medium from its source to the location at which it
//  was detected. The program should then report how far away (in meters) the source of
//  the sound was from the detection location.
//
//  Input Validation: Check that the user has selected one of the available menu choices.
//  Do not accept times less than 0 seconds or more than 30 seconds.
